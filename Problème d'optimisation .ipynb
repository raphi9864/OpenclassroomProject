Here, it is not enough to determine if a tour exists; rather, the goal is to find the tour with the minimum length that starts and ends at a specific city (here $vn$) and visits each city exactly once. The length $k$ here refers to the total distance of this optimal tour. The adjacency matrix $D$ is used to calculate the distances between cities and find the optimal solution."
